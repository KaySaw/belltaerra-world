The **Elven Elders** are the long-established rulers of the forest, a council composed of venerable figures who hold steadfastly to the traditions of their ancestors. These elders have governed the kingdom of elves for generations, ensuring that the forest remained a sanctuary of peace, balance, and reverence for nature. They believe in the intrinsic connection between their people and the land, asserting that they are the chosen custodians of the forest, tasked with maintaining its purity and guarding its ancient secrets.

The Elven Elders see their role as guardians of a delicate equilibrium. Their approach is one of conservation, respecting the slow rhythms of the natural world and preserving the forest’s ancient magic. To them, any disruption to the forest’s essence is not only a crime against their homeland but a betrayal of their heritage and the goddess Venaria.

Under their rule, the Sacred Forest has remained a largely insular and discriminatory society, with outsiders rarely welcomed. The Elders prefer the forest to be a place of refuge for those who live in harmony with its natural order and resist any outside influence or modernization that could endanger the balance they have upheld for centuries.
