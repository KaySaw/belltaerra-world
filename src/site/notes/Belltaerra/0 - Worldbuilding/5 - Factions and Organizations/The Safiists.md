In stark contrast to the Elders, the **Safiists** are a burgeoning faction led by the charismatic half-elf half-orc, **Safia**, who dreams of a more egalitarian society. This faction is composed not only of rebellious younger elves but also of other fey and outcasts who have grown disillusioned with the Elders’ conservative rule. Safia herself is a firebrand leader, promising her followers a future where all people, regardless of race or lineage, can live freely and with equal rights, unburdened by the weight of tradition.

The Safiists view the Elders’ governance as oppressive and stagnant, believing that the forest is being smothered by archaic customs. They argue that the forest’s magic should be harnessed for the benefit of all its people, and that the Elders' isolationist policies have stifled innovation and growth. To them, the Sacred Forest should be open to new ideas, and the fey descendants who reside there should have a voice in shaping their own destiny.

However, their revolutionary zeal comes at a cost. The Safiists have resorted to increasingly violent means in their struggle for change, from sabotaging the Elders' holdings to engaging in covert warfare within the forest. Their methods have alienated some potential allies, and their willingness to use force has cast a shadow over their ideals, leading to deeper divisions within the forest society.
