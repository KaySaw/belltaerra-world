The **Founding Memorial Day** is one of the most significant and celebrated festivals in the **Grand Kingdom of Bellaria**, marking the anniversary of the kingdom's founding and honoring the legacy of its rulers. Held annually in the capital city of **Bellarion**, the event is a grand spectacle of tradition, reverence, and joy that unites the kingdom's citizens in remembrance of their heritage and anticipation for the future.

The festival begins with a solemn **Dawn Procession**, led by clergy and nobles, who march from the **Royal Palace** to the Decorated City Square. As the sun rises, the crowd gathers to witness the **hoisting of the Royal Flag**, a ceremonial act that symbolizes the unbroken line of the royal family and the enduring strength of the kingdom.

As the day progresses, the mood shifts from solemnity to celebration. The streets of Bellarion are transformed into a vibrant scene of market stalls, performances, and competitions. **Tournaments** are held in the city’s main square, where knights compete in jousts, archery, and swordsmanship, while bards and minstrels perform songs recounting Bellaria’s glorious history.

At the heart of the festival lies the **Feast of Unity**, a grand banquet held in the palace courtyard, where nobles, dignitaries, and commoners alike partake in a shared meal. The feast represents the harmony between the various regions of Bellaria, bringing together people of all walks of life to dine in honor of the kingdom's past and future.

The highlight of the Founding Memorial Day is the **Royal Address**, where the king or queen speaks to the people, reaffirming their dedication to the kingdom. This year, however, the festival will be especially monumental, as **Prince Alastair Bellumia** is set to be crowned king during the ceremony. His coronation, entwined with the Founding Memorial Day, is expected to be a momentous occasion, marking the dawn of a new era in Bellaria’s history.

The festival concludes with a breathtaking **Fireworks Display**, illuminating the night sky over Bellarion as the citizens revel in the glory of their kingdom’s past. The Founding Memorial Day stands as both a tribute to Bellaria’s heritage and a celebration of the unity and strength that continues to define the kingdom.
