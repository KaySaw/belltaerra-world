### **Nature of the Gods**

The gods of Belltaerra are less like individual beings and more like cosmic phenomena, their essence tied to the natural cycles of the world. For example, **Sey'na**, the Goddess of the Cycle, represents the continuous ebb and flow of life and death, an eternal force that sustains the balance of existence. **Aestus**, the God of the Sea and Tides, is the relentless pull of the ocean, the rhythm of the waves crashing upon the shore, and the deep currents that run through the world's waters. **Ultime**, the God of Time and Fate, is the unseen passage of time, the inevitable march toward destiny that no one can escape.

Though they are formless and cannot manifest directly in the physical world, they possess the ability to communicate with mortals. To do so, they assume temporary forms—often ethereal, symbolic, or abstract representations of their domain. For instance, **Sur**, the God of the Sun and Light, may communicate through a radiant beam of sunlight, a burning figure of fire, or a golden bird flying through the sky. **Nyxia**, the Goddess of Night and Shadows, may appear as a dark silhouette, a whisper in the shadows, or the shifting forms seen in dreams.

### **Divine Communication**

When the gods communicate, their voices carry a weight that can be felt more than heard, often manifesting through signs in nature, visions, or omens. Their messages are cryptic, reflecting their otherworldly nature and their distance from mortal concerns. They do not directly alter events in the world but offer guidance, warnings, or inspiration to those attuned to their essence. Much like nature itself, their presence is subtle but profound, influencing life through indirect means.

For example, a devastating storm might be seen as the work of **Aether**, the God of the Sky, expressing anger or grief, but **Aether** would not consciously choose to create the storm; it simply reflects the god’s nature. Similarly, **Belmud**, the God of War and Chaos, would not choose to ignite a war, but the inevitable conflict and disorder that arise in the world are expressions of his essence. The gods' actions are felt in the world like natural forces, beyond the control of even the gods themselves.

### **Origins of the Gods**

The gods of Belltaerra did not originate as living beings or individuals; rather, they are the ancient forces that were born alongside the creation of the world. In the early days, when Belltaerra was still forming, these primal forces coalesced from the raw energies of existence. The [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/1 - Magic/0 Nature of Magic/Aetheric Stream\|Aetheric Stream]] breathed life into these cosmic forces, giving form to concepts like time, the earth, the sky, and the cycle of life and death.

According to Belltaerran myth, at the dawn of creation, the universe was a vast, formless void, with only the Stream. Out of this chaos, the first currents of power began to emerge. These forces—fire, air, earth, water, light, and darkness—gave shape to the world, and from these elements, the gods were born. They were not consciously created; rather, they arose from the need for balance and order in the universe. Each god represents a crucial aspect of existence, such as the flow of time, the fertility of the land, or the mysteries of the stars.
