The **Aetheric Stream** is the fundamental source of magic in the world of **Aeloria**, existing as a vast, invisible network of arcane energy that binds existence itself. Magic users in the world tap into this **universal force** to cast spells, manipulate reality, and shape the fabric of life. Often described as an intricate web of interconnected "strings," the Stream flows throughout all living things, the land, the sky, and even the stars.

The Aetheric Stream functions as an ever-present current of magical power that envelops the world. **Arcane practitioners** perceive this energy as a symphony of strings vibrating with the essence of creation. **Spellcasters** are taught to pluck at these strings in delicate ways, unleashing arcane effects that alter reality. The complexity of a spell determines the number of strings disturbed; the greater the magic, the more strings are metaphorically plucked, causing ripple effects across the Stream.

The flow of magic in the Aetheric Stream is not uniform. It can pool in certain locations and grow weaker in others. **[[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/1 - Magic/1 Ley Lines and Nexuses/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]]**, the concentrated rivers of this magical current, act as conduits of intense power that weave across the world.

Certain places in Belltaerra are infused with **Ley lines**, where the Aetheric Stream flows stronger than elsewhere, making them naturally more magical. These Ley lines converge at **[[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/1 - Magic/1 Ley Lines and Nexuses/Ley Nexuses\|Ley Nexuses]]**, sites of immense arcane energy. In such locations, reality itself may be warped by the power of the Stream. These places are exceedingly rare but are highly coveted for their power.

# Using the Aetheric Stream

While every spellcaster draws from the Aetheric Stream, their methods differ depending on the form of magic they practice. For example:

- **Wizards** study the flow and structure of the Stream, using careful calculations to manipulate it with precision.
- **Sorcerers** have a natural affinity for the Stream, allowing them to tap into its currents instinctively, often wielding raw, untamed power.
- **Druids** and **Clerics** harness specific aspects of the Stream through their connection to nature or divine forces, reflecting the gods or the natural world’s influence on the Stream.

Magic users must take care, however, for reckless tampering with the Stream can cause unintended consequences, rippling through reality in unpredictable ways. Overdrawing on the Stream’s power can lead to destabilizing rifts or worse—tearing the very fabric of existence.
