A **Ley Nexus** is a rare and powerful location where multiple **[[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/1 - Magic/1 Ley Lines and Nexuses/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]]** converge, creating a focal point of immense magical energy. These sites often exhibit extraordinary properties. Because of their inherent power, Ley Nexuses are often places of great spiritual or magical significance, and many are carefully guarded or revered by local populations.

Mages and scholars in Belltaerra closely study these nexuses, and in places like the **[[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/4 - Geography/Regions/The Hallowed Lands of Sey'nar/Key Landmarks/Luminous City of Sey'naris\|Luminous City]]**, entire orders—such as the **[[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/5 - Factions and Organizations/Leywardens\|Leywardens]]**—are dedicated to regulating and protecting these sites. Proper care of a Ley Nexus is essential, as disturbances to the nexus can lead to magical instability, sometimes with catastrophic consequences.
