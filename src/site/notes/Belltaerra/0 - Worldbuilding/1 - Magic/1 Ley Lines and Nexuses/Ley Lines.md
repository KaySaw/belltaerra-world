**Ley Lines** are invisible pathways of concentrated magical energy that crisscross the world of **[[Belltaerra/Belltaerra\|Belltaerra]]**, carrying the flow of the **[[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/1 - Magic/0 Nature of Magic/Aetheric Stream\|Aetheric Stream]]**. These lines act as conduits, directing the arcane forces of the world through the land, the sea, and even the air. Spellcasters and those sensitive to magic can tap into Ley Lines to amplify their spells or draw from the latent power that flows through them.

While Ley Lines can sometimes be detected by powerful mages, they are generally hidden to the untrained eye. In areas where these lines intersect or pool, they create **[[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/1 - Magic/1 Ley Lines and Nexuses/Ley Nexuses\|Ley Nexuses]]**, where magic is far more potent. Many believe that Ley Lines were established by the gods during the creation of the world, harmonizing untamed magical currents into the veins of the universe.
