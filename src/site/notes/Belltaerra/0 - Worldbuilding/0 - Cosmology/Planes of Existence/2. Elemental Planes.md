The Elemental Planes are four realms, representing one of the fundamental forces of nature -- earth, air, fire and water. These realms are raw and untamed, containing the purest essence of the elements and are home to elemental beings.

**The Four Elemental Planes**:

- **Plane of Earth**: A realm of endless mountains, caves, and shifting stone, reflecting the solidity and permanence of the earth itself. Beings such as earth elementals, gargoyles, and stone giants call this plane home.
- **Plane of Air**: A vast sky with no ground, filled with constant winds and storms, embodying freedom and the untouchable expanse of the sky. Air elementals, djinn, and giant birds rule this plane.
- **Plane of Fire**: A plane of endless flame and molten landscapes, representing destruction and creation in equal measure. Fire elementals, efreeti, and fire giants are native to this realm.
- **Plane of Water**: A boundless ocean where life is abundant but alien, representing change, adaptability, and the cycle of life. Water elementals, marids, and krakens thrive here.
