The Shadowfell is a dark, gloomy reflection of the Material Plane, shrouded in eternal twilight. It is the plane of shadows, and melancholy, embodying the influence of [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/3 - Religion and Festivals/The Belltaerran Pantheon/Nyxia, The Goddess of Night and Shadows\|Nyxia, The Goddess of Night and Shadows]]. The atmosphere in the Shadowfell is bleak and oppressive, filled with echoes of the dead and forgotten memories.

The Shadowfell serves as a counterpart to the Material plane, a mirror world where the dead who resist [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/3 - Religion and Festivals/The Belltaerran Pantheon/Sey'na, The Goddess of Life and Death\|Sey'na]]'s cycle may wander. It is a plane where shades and spirits linger, unable to find peace and move on to the [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/0 - Cosmology/Planes of Existence/1. Astral Plane\|Astral Plane]]. Necromancers often draw upon the energies of the Shadowfell.

Shadowfell is where undeath takes root. It is from this plane that undead entities such as ghosts, wraiths and liches draw power. Mortals who wander it for too long risk being pulled into its eternal despair.
