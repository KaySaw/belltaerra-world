The Celestial Realms are a plane of divine and radiant energy, often associated with the gods of light, and law, such as [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/3 - Religion and Festivals/The Belltaerran Pantheon/Sur, The God of Sun and Light\|Sur, The God of Sun and Light]] and [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/3 - Religion and Festivals/The Belltaerran Pantheon/Veritas, The Goddess of Truth and Justice\|Veritas, The Goddess of Truth and Justice]]. 

This plane is often seen as an afterlife for the righteous and those blessed by the gods of light. However, as Belltaerran gods are more abstract forces, the Celestial Realms are more symbolic representations of harmony, balance, and the higher ideals of life. Mortals rarely visit these realms unless called by divine intervention. These realms are home to angels, archons and other radiant entities. Very little is known about this plane, beyond it's existence.
