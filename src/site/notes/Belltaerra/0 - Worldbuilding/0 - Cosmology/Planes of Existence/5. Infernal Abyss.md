The Infernal Abyss is a chaotic, destructive plane dominated by the essence of [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/3 - Religion and Festivals/The Belltaerran Pantheon/Belmud, The God of War and Chaos\|Belmud, The God of War and Chaos]]. It is a barren, ashy wasteland with lava oceans and igneous rock formations jutting sporadically from the landscape. It is a lawless plane of malevolence, where demons, devils and other infernal beings live.

The Infernal Abyss represents the raw, untamed forces of chaos and conflict that threaten to disrupt the natural order. While Belltaerraâ€™s pantheon strives to maintain balance, the Abyss embodies the chaos that forever pushes against that order.
