The Feywild is a plane of vibrant, wild magic and primal energy, where all creatures are locked in an everlasting hunt. This hunt is both a literal and spiritual force, driving everything within the Feywild. Predator and Prey roles are constantly shifting, and all beings -- fey, beasts, and even plants -- are engaged in this ruthless cycle of survival and pursuit, embodying the unpredictable energy of [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/3 - Religion and Festivals/The Belltaerran Pantheon/Venaria, The Goddess of Beasts and Wilderness\|Venaria, The Goddess of Beasts and Wilderness]].

The landscapes reflect the hunt, with dense forests, vast meadows, and ever sifting terrain that make each chase unpredictable. Time flows irregularly, and the very land rearranges itself, making survival a true test of strength and cunning. The magic of the Feywild is deeply tied to this primal energy, growing strong during moments of pursuit.

This plane is home to fey creatures such as Satyrs, Dryads, Pixies, Spirits and other Beastly entities. While some of these creatures may be found in the [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/0 - Cosmology/Planes of Existence/0. Material Plane\|Material Plane]], their fey counterparts are more primal, ancient, and _deadly._ Few dare to travel to the Feywild, but those who have survived it and come back alive, all advise strongly never to set foot there.
