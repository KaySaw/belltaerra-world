The Void of Fate is a unique, enigmatic plane governed by [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/3 - Religion and Festivals/The Belltaerran Pantheon/Ultime, the God of Time and Fate\|Ultime, the God of Time and Fate]]. This plane exists outside of normal time, where past, present and future are all visible at once, making it an abstract and incomprehensible plane to mortals. 

The void is where the flow of time is regulated, and it plays a crucial role in ensuring the stability of the universe. Mortals who somehow manage to glimpse at this plane may - theoretically - experience visions of their fate, or see echoes of the past. However, interacting with this plane is dangerous, as it can disrupt the natural flow of time, and fracture one's mind beyond repair. Ambitious mages throughout history who have dared, in their folly to understand and conquer this plane have all had their psyche destroyed irreparably.
