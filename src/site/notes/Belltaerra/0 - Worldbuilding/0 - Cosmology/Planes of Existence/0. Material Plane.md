The Material Plane is the primary realm where mortals, creature and physical elements exist. The planet of Aeloria is located in this plane. So are the stars, and all of the directly perceivable reality. This plane is bound by the physical laws of nature, but infused with the energy of the Aetheric Stream, allowing magic to flow and interact with the natural world.

The Material Plane represents the center of existence, where the forces of nature, magic and gods converge to shape the everyday life of its inhabitants. Mortals live out their lives here, interacting with both natural and supernatural elements.

Magical [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/1 - Magic/1 Ley Lines and Nexuses/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] crisscross the Material Plane, creating areas of intense magical energy known as [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/1 - Magic/1 Ley Lines and Nexuses/Ley Nexuses\|Ley Nexuses]]. These points are where the influence of the Aetheric Stream is felt in a greater quantity, leading to extraordinary phenomena.
