The Astral Plane is a vast, shimmering expanse of pure thought, potential and psychic energy. It is often referred to as the "The Ocean Beyond" because it is where the souls of the dead roam after death, guided by the natural cycle governed by [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/3 - Religion and Festivals/The Belltaerran Pantheon/Sey'na, The Goddess of Life and Death\|Sey'na, The Goddess of Life and Death]]. 

The Astral Plane serves as a waystation between life and death. Souls journey through this realm to be reborn or to rest, depending on the will of Sey'na and the natural cycle of existence. For mortals who visit this realm, time and space are fluid and abstract, making it a place of deep meditation, prophecy, and visions. Mortals may accidentally or intentionally venture here during sleep or through powerful magic.
