Belltaerra was once a vast and prosperous continent, united under a single ruler known as The Grand King. This unity was maintained not only through the king's leadership but also with the aid of the Oracle, a mysterious figure belonging to a group of enigmatic witches. These Oracles would appear seemingly from nowhere, claiming to come from the [[Forbidden Island\|Forbidden Island]], a place to the southeast of Belltaerra. This island was shrouded in mystery, surrounded by an impassable storm that formed a veil around it. It was said that only the Oracles possessed the knowledge of navigating through this tempest.

However, the Oracles have been missing since the Fracture, and there has been no new Oracle for 974 years.
