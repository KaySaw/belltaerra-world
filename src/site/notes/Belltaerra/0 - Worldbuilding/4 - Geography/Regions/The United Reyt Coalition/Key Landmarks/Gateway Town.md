Nestled at the entrance of the Reyt Desert, **Gateway Town** is a fortress-city perched on cliffs overlooking a massive gate of ancient metal. This gate marks the primary entrance to the desert, and **Liva**, the Lord of the Gate, stands as the first line of defense against invaders and unwanted travelers. The town is a formidable bastion, with high walls and watchful sentries. Despite the town's stern defenses, rumors persist that Liva has a softer side, known only to those who gain her trust.
