The **Citadel** is a stronghold for the condemned, a desolate fortress deep within the desert where criminals, outlaws, and forsaken souls are sent to live out their days. Ruled by the enigmatic **Eclipse**, the Lord of the Damned, the Citadel is shrouded in mystery. It is said that the Citadel’s walls hold dark secrets and that its ruler commands a vast army of criminals and outcasts. The barren lands around the Citadel are a reflection of its ruler's rule—harsh, merciless, and enigmatic.
