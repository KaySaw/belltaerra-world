Dolat, the capital city of the Coalition, is a sprawling metropolis located at the heart of the desert, where trade routes converge. It is a vibrant, chaotic center of commerce, with bustling markets selling exotic goods from across the continent. Ghania, the Lord of Coin, governs the city with a shrewd, mercantile mind, ensuring the Coalitionâ€™s wealth flows through its veins. Dolat serves as a beacon of wealth amidst the desert's vast emptiness, drawing merchants and travelers from all corners of Belltaerra. Despite its prosperity, Dolat is a city where cutthroat competition thrives, and power is measured in coin.
