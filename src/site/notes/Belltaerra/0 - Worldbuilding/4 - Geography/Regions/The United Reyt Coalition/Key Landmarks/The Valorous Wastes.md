The Valorous Wastes are a treacherous region known for its fierce wildlife and harsh terrain. The Wastes are where the most skilled hunters roam, and it is here that **Viriam**, the Lord of the Hunt, commands his Wyvern Knights and oversees the grand hunting tournaments that have earned him fame. Jagged canyons, towering sand dunes, and hidden caves dot the landscape, making it both a deadly hunting ground and a symbol of the Coalitionâ€™s strength. Those who seek to prove their valor travel here, hoping to earn a place among the legends of the Wastes.
