The **Lords of the Sand** are the ruling powers of the **United Reyt Coalition**, each commanding their own distinct domain within the vast Reyt Desert. These five enigmatic figures are both feared and revered, their influence shaping the coalition’s political and cultural landscape. Each Lord embodies a unique aspect of desert life, from the harshness of survival to the allure of indulgence.

- **Viriam, the Lord of the Hunt**: A master of the Valorous Wastes, where hunters seek glory and trophies under his fierce, disciplined rule. He leads the Wyvern Knights and is known for his valor and competitive spirit.
- **Eclipse, the Lord of the Damned**: A mysterious figure who rules the Citadel, a fortress for the irredeemable criminals of the desert. Their motives remain ever shrouded in darkness, and their dominion a place of both fear and intrigue.
- **Ghania, the Lord of Coin**: The shrewd ruler of Dolat, the capital city and heart of trade in the coalition. She holds the economic reins of the desert, her vast wealth and influence keeping her power unquestioned.
- **Liva, the Lord of the Gate**: A stoic guardian of the Gateway Town, which controls the only entrance into the desert. With an iron will and little tolerance for trespassers, she oversees the ancient gates with stern authority.
- **Lavender, the Lord of the Night**: The seductive ruler of the Sanguine Oases, a red-light district that serves as a nexus of vice and indulgence. Cloaked in charm and mystery, Lavender’s domain thrives under his charismatic yet cunning leadership.

Together, these five Lords hold the coalition together through a tenuous balance of power, each shaping their corner of the desert in their own image.
