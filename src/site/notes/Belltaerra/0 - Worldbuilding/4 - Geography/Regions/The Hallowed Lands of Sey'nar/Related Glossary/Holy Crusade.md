**The Holy Crusade**, a solemn duty bestowed upon the faithful followers of Sey'na, is both a test of faith and a harrowing journey into the heart of darkness. Led by the appointed champions of the Supreme Church, these brave souls venture forth into the dreaded **[[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/4 - Geography/Regions/The Hallowed Lands of Sey'nar/Key Landmarks/Graveyard of Heroes Past\|Graveyard of Heroes Past]]**, a vast and desolate expanse teeming with the restless souls of the undead.

The Crusaders, armed with divine blessings and clad in armor forged from vibrant metals, march steadfastly towards the heart of the graveyard, their resolve unshakable even in the face of certain peril. Theirs is a sacred duty, to purge the land of the taint of undeath and to usher the souls of the fallen into the embrace of the goddess.

Adventurers from all over the continent join the crusaders in this battle, eager to prove their mettle, and seeking ancient artefacts from a bygone era.

The battles that rage within the graveyard are fierce and relentless, as wave after wave of undead horrors assail those who venture there with unholy fervor. For those who survive the ordeal, the Holy Crusade is a testament to their unwavering devotion and their willingness to sacrifice everything in the service of their goddess...or a proof of their undeniable strength. And though the Graveyard may claim many lives, the flame of hope burns ever bright in those who brave the perils of the land, guiding them further and further into the miasma.
