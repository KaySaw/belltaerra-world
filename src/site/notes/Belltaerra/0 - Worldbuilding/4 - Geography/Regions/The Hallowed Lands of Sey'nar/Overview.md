The central figurehead of the Supreme Church is the enigmatic **[[Belltaerra/1 - Campaign Resources/7 - The Tale of the Inquisitors/2 Important NPCs/Supreme Archbishop\|Supreme Archbishop]]**, a mysterious and revered figure who shrouds themselves in anonymity. Never showing their face to the masses, the Archbishop communicates only through their voice, which echoes with an otherworldly resonance that commands reverence from all who hear it.

Despite the dominance of the Supreme Church of Sey'na, other religions still hold sway in Belltaerra, each offering its own interpretation of their divine and its place in the world.

And as long as the archbishop's voice continues to echo through the halls of the cathedral, the pious will continue to flock to Sey'nar in search of guidance and enlightenment.
