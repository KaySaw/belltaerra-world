Sey'naris, the capital of the Hallowed Lands of Sey'nar, is a breathtaking city built upon a powerful [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/1 - Magic/1 Ley Lines and Nexuses/Ley Nexuses\|Ley Nexus]], infusing it with radiant, mystical energy. The city is famous for its pristine white buildings, each structure carefully crafted from shimmering stone that reflects the light of the ley energy coursing beneath the earth. The roads are paved with pale cobblestones, creating a seamless flow of white and silver throughout the cityscape. Cascading waterfalls flow through the city's canals, enhancing its natural beauty and bringing the sound of gently running water to every corner.

In the heart of Sey'naris, a majestic hill rises, crowned by the **Grand Cathedral of Sey'na**, a monumental temple dedicated to the Goddess of the Cycle of Life and Death. This cathedral is the focal point of the city, towering over the plains and visible from miles away. Pilgrims and devout followers often travel to Sey'naris to experience the spiritual energy of the cathedral and pay homage to the goddess.

One of the most awe-inspiring features of Sey'naris is its radiant energy. Due to the ley nexus beneath, columns of glowing energy occasionally burst from the ground like vapors, creating pillars of radiant light that dot the city. These energy pillars bask the streets in a soft, otherworldly glow, as if the city itself is alive with magic.

Within it's hallowed halls, priests and priestesses, clerics and paladins tend to the spiritual needs of the faithful, and their duties to the [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/4 - Geography/Regions/The Hallowed Lands of Sey'nar/Related Glossary/Holy Crusade\|Holy Crusade]].
