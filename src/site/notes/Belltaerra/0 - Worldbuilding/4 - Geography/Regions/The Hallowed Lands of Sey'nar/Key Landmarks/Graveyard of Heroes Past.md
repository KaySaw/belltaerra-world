Located near the southeastern part of the Hallowed Lands of Sey'nar, the Graveyard of Heroes Past is a land shrouded in miasma and shadow, where the echoes of battles long fought still linger in the air like whispers of the past. Here, the fallen heroes of bygone eras rise once more, their bodies twisted and corrupted by the dark energies that permeate the land.
