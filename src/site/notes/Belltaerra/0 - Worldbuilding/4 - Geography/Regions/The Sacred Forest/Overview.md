The Sacred Forest, nestled in the northern reaches of Belltaerra, is a realm of unparalleled beauty and untold mysteries. Enshrouded in the mists of legend and myth, this ancient evergreen woodland is a haven for fey descendants and a sanctuary for those attuned to the natural world.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**History:** For generations, the forest has been home to a kingdom of elves, ruled by a council of elders who have guided their people with wisdom and grace. Under their stewardship, the forest flourished, its towering evergreens and shimmering lakes serving as a refuge for those who sought solace amidst its verdant depths.

However, in recent years, the tranquillity of the Sacred Forest has been shattered by the echoes of Civil War. Two opposing factions now vie for control, each driven by their own vision of the future and their own interpretation of the forest's ancient traditions.

On one side stand the **[[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/5 - Factions and Organizations/Elven Elders\|Elven Elders]]**, staunch traditionalists who cling fiercely to the customs and beliefs of their forebears. For them, the forest is not just a home but a sacred trust, to be protected and preserved at all costs. They see themselves as the guardians of the old ways, entrusted with maintaining the delicate balance between nature and civilization, to keep the forests pure.

Opposing them is a new and radical faction, **[[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/5 - Factions and Organizations/The Safiists\|The Safiists]]**, named after their leader Safia composed of elves and other fey who reject the constraints of tradition in favour of a more egalitarian society. Led by Safia's charisma, they're promised equality and justice for all, regardless of race or lineage, as they seek to overthrow the old order and usher in a new era of change and progress.

Yet, for all their noble intentions, the methods employed by this extremist faction are as divisive as they are effective. Their willingness to embrace violence and subterfuge in pursuit of their goals has alienated many of their erstwhile allies, leading to a schism within the forest that threatens to tear it apart from within.

**Geography:** The **Sacred Forest**, located in the northern reaches of **Belltaerra**, is a sprawling evergreen woodland, a place of ancient beauty and mystical power. Towering trees, some of which have stood for millennia, stretch towards the heavens, their massive trunks wrapped in moss and ivy. Shimmering lakes and winding rivers cut through the dense foliage, reflecting the dappled sunlight that filters through the thick canopy above. These waters are said to possess restorative properties, believed by the elves to be blessed by the goddess **Venaria** herself.

In the wake of the growing civil strife, the once peaceful forest has become divided. Areas once serene are now battlegrounds between the Elders and the Safiists, with certain regions marked by violence and tension. The deeper groves, once considered sacred, have been infiltrated by both factions, their tranquility shattered by the constant struggle for dominance.

_The below aspects of the Sacred Forest have been affected by the war, and while parts of the culture still endure in deeper parts, the Forest is currently in a state of turmoil._

**Society and Culture:** The elves of the Sacred Forest live in harmony with nature, maintaining traditions that promote sustainability. Their society values artistry and storytelling, with festivals highlighting their rich cultural heritage and connection to the natural world. 

**Economy:** The economy is largely self-sustaining, based on agriculture, foraging, and trade with neighboring regions. Alchemists and Druids are highly regarded for their concoctions, remedies and elixirs, which reflect their deep connection to nature.

**Trade:** Trade in the Sacred Forest is cautious, emphasizing the protection of resources. The elves trade unique goods, such as herbal remedies, oils, herbs and medicinal plants with neighboring societies while being selective about their interactions to preserve their way of life.

**Values and Beliefs:** Elven values center on harmony with nature, respect for tradition, and the preservation of their cultural heritage. The council of Elders guides the community, balancing the need for progress with the importance of maintaining ancient customs.
