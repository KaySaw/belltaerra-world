**Nīvis Aeternum** is the eternal winter that blankets the southern reaches of Belltaerra, specifically the towering **Southern Peaks** where the **Indomitable Empire of Glavallis** is nestled. This unyielding frost creates a landscape of constant snowfall, glacial winds, and frozen terrain, rendering the region both isolated and nearly impenetrable. The harsh conditions shape every aspect of life within Glavallis, from the architecture of its fortress cities to the resilience of its people.

Legends speak of ancient powers tied to this eternal winter, with some believing that **Nīvis Aeternum** is not a natural phenomenon, but the lingering influence of a long-forgotten curse or perhaps the result of Glavallis' rumored connection to an ancient ice dragon. Regardless of its origin, **Nīvis Aeternum** is a defining feature of the empire, both a guardian and a challenge for those who dwell within its icy embrace.
