The Indomitable Empire of Glavallis is a secluded and formidable realm, nestled deep within the frozen embrace of the Southern Peaks of Belltaerra. Known for its impenetrable defenses and ancient lineage, it has earned a reputation for its military strength and neutrality. The empire’s existence is bound to the harsh environment of the southern mountains, where an eternal winter—known as [[Belltaerra/0 - Worldbuilding/4 - Geography/Regions/The Indomitable Empire of Glavallis/Related Glossary/nīvis aeternum\|nīvis aeternum]]—blankets the land in snow and ice. Despite these harsh conditions, Glavallis thrives, its people hardened by the unforgiving climate and its rulers enforcing iron-fisted control. Though shrouded in mystery, whispers of the empire’s rulers possessing draconic power abound, with legends hinting at the presence of an ancient ice dragon. Outsiders rarely venture into the capital, and fewer still return, adding to the enigmatic aura that surrounds it. Glavallis maintains its independence, never engaging in wars unless provoked. Invaders who dared to challenge its sovereignty have met their demise, buried in the snows they once sought to conquer. The empire is often seen as an immovable, unshakable bastion, living up to its name as indomitable.

**Geography:** The **Indomitable Empire of Glavallis** is located in the southernmost region of Belltaerra, cradled within the icy **Southern Peaks**. These towering mountains, known as the **Shield of Belltaerra**, act as both a natural barrier and a protector for the continent, deflecting the freezing southern winds that blow in from the frozen expanse beyond. The Shield’s peaks are the tallest on the continent, their snow-covered tips piercing the sky like jagged spears. This geographic advantage makes Glavallis one of the most defensible regions in the world.

The landscape of Glavallis is dominated by towering mountains, frozen lakes, and ancient glaciers. The ever-present **nīvis aeternum**, or eternal winter, cloaks the empire in perpetual snow and frost. Rivers of glacial meltwater wind through the valleys, but vegetation is sparse, limited to hardy evergreens and frost-resistant plants. The region is isolated from the rest of Belltaerra by its treacherous mountain passes, which are often impassable during the harshest parts of the year. The empire’s capital, Nox Glacia, is situated deep within these mountains, using the natural landscape as part of its defensive infrastructure.
