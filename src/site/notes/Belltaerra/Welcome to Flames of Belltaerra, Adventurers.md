**Welcome to Belltaerra**, a continent once united under a mighty Grand Kingdom but now shattered by centuries of betrayal, war, and mystery. Nearly a millennium has passed since **The Fracture**, a cataclysmic event that tore the kingdom apart, leaving behind a land divided by power-hungry factions and fragmented realms. The cause of the Fracture remains unknown to the common people, obscured by whispers of magic gone awry, dark secrets, and the disappearance of the mysterious Oracles who once guided the realm.

In this campaign, you and your fellow adventurers find yourselves in the year 974, a time when old wounds still fester, and new threats loom on the horizon. As the fractured regions of Belltaerra cling to fragile peace, powerful forces stir beneath the surface. Ancient powers once buried beneath the earth begin to awaken, and rumors of a forgotten prophecy, tied to the Forbidden Isle and the lost Oracles, spread through hushed circles.

But as dark shadows gather, so too do unlikely heroes arise. Will you uncover the long-buried truth behind Belltaerra’s downfall? Will you face the remnants of ancient magic, long thought lost? Or will you forge a new destiny for yourselves, navigating the political intrigue, ley-line anomalies, and primal forces of a fractured world?

The fate of Belltaerra lies in your hands, adventurers. Welcome to **The Flames of Belltaerra** – where history, magic, and destiny collide, and your choices will shape the future of a broken realm.
