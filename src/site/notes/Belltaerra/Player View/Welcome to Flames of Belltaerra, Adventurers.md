Welcome to the world of Belltaerra!

## The Fracture
The Fracture, a devastating event etched into Belltaerra's history, marks the violent collapse of the once-unified Grand Kingdom. In 1104 of the [[Golden Era\|Golden Era]], what began as a series of seemingly natural disasters and societal unrest escalated into a full-scale civil war. The harmonious balance of the realm unraveled, with crops failing, magic becoming unpredictable, and whispers of tyranny and corruption spreading across the land. Rebellions broke out, fueled by fear, distrust, and the belief that the Grand King had lost control of his kingdom.

The war that followed was brutal, with factions rising against the crown, each vying for power as the realm descended into chaos. By the time the conflict ended, the Royal Bloodline had been wiped out, and Belltaerra lay in ruins. The once-great kingdom shattered into the separate territories now known today, each ruled by its own warlords, nobles, or factions. The cause of the collapse remains a mystery to the general populace, but the event came to be known as **The Fracture**, a symbol of the continentâ€™s fall from unity and the dawn of an era of fragmentation.

The Oracles vanished soon after, leaving only whispers and legends of their once-mysterious guidance. To this day, the people of Belltaerra remember the Fracture as a dark turning point, its true cause lost to time and shadow. It is now 974 years after the Fracture, in the [[Fractured Era\|Fractured Era]]. The times are peaceful...but who knows what brews in the dark?
